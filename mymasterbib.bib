abstract = "We present some results about the representation ring of the quantum double of a finite group over fields of arbitrary characteristic. We give a direct sum decomposition of this representation ring into ideals involving Green rings of subgroups. Given characters of such Green rings, we construct characters of the representation ring of the quantum double and show that all characters arise in this fashion. We prove that the characters thereby obtained from Brauer characters separate modules of the quantum double up to composition factors."

abstract = "This graduate textbook presents the basics of representation theory for finite groups from the point of view of semisimple algebras and modules over them. The presentation interweaves insights from specific examples with development of general and powerful tools based on the notion of semisimplicity. The elegant ideas of commutant duality are introduced, along with an introduction to representations of unitary groups.�The text progresses systematically and the presentation is friendly and inviting. Central concepts are revisited and explored�from multiple viewpoints. Exercises at the end of the chapter help reinforce the material. Representing Finite Groups: A Semisimple Introduction would serve as a textbook for graduate and some advanced undergraduate courses in mathematics. Prerequisites include acquaintance with elementary group theory and some familiarity with rings and modules. A final chapter presents a self-contained account of notions and results in algebra that are used. Researchers in mathematics and mathematical physics will also find this book useful. A separate solutions manual is available for instructors.",

abstract = {<p>In this paper, the Drinfeld center of a monoidal category is generalized to a class of mixed Drinfeld centers. This gives a unified picture for the Drinfeld center and a natural Heisenberg analogue. Further, there is an action of the former on the latter. This picture is translated to a description in terms of Yetter–Drinfeld and Hopf modules over quasi-bialgebras in a braided monoidal category. Via braided reconstruction theory, intrinsic definitions of braided Drinfeld and Heisenberg doubles are obtained, together with a generalization of the result of Lu [22] that the Heisenberg double is a 2-cocycle twist of the Drinfeld double for general braided Hopf algebras.</p>},
