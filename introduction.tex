\section{Summary}
In Part \ref{part_3} I have tried to elaborate further on the main twisting result of the preprint \cite{twistsrcas} being written by Bazlov, Berenstein, McGaw and myself. In that preprint we showed two particular instances of braided Cherednik algebras are related by a ``Drinfeld twist''. Here I make use of a paper by Naidu and Witherspoon \cite{2011arXiv11115243N} in which the class of ``quantum Drinfeld Hecke algebras'' (which include braided Cherednik algebras) arise as deformations of their associated graded rings. In Section \ref{claim_3_sec} we prove that, under certain conditions, Drinfeld twists and deformations are compatible, therefore allowing us to derive twisting results between quantum Drinfeld Hecke algebras from simpler twisting results between graded rings.
